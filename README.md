# Collect-and-Clean-data--Project
# Project Overview
This project is intended to demmostrate ability to collect data, work with it and clean it making sure the datasets are tidy and ready for analysis.


## Dataset Desccription
In this project I will be using data collected form the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, a full description of this data is available at the site where the data was obtained.

## What to do:
The project requires creation of one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Results
After all is done the project produced:
1. An R script called [run_analysis.R](https://github.com/Claire-Kimbugwe/Collect-and-Clean-data--Project/blob/master/run_analysis.R) that was used to perform the analysis.
2. A tidy csv file called [tidydata.csv](https://github.com/Claire-Kimbugwe/Collect-and-Clean-data--Project/blob/master/Tidydata.csv) based on the original data set
3.A text file called [tidydata.txt] (https://github.com/Claire-Kimbugwe/Collect-and-Clean-data--Project/blob/master/tidydata.txt).
3. A code book called [CodeBook.md] (https://github.com/Claire-Kimbugwe/Collect-and-Clean-data--Project/blob/master/CodeBook.md) describeing variables, data and any transformations of work performed to clean up the data
